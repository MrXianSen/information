/**
 * Base class to receive parsing exceptions.
 *
 * If this class is used as callback, then Smack will silently ignore the stanza that caused the parsing exception and
 * place the parser after the faulty stanza.
 *
 * Subclasses may or may not override certain methods of this class. Each of these methods will receive the exception
 * that caused the parsing error and an instance of an Unparsed Packet type. The latter can be used to inspect the
 * stanza that caused the parsing error by using the getContent() (for example {@link UnparsedIQ#getContent()})
 * method.
 *
 * Smack provides 2 predefined ParsingExceptionCallback's: {@link ExceptionLoggingCallback} and {@link ExceptionThrowingCallback}.
